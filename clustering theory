## ** KMeans**

* **Hyperparameter:** `n_clusters = k` (number of clusters)
* **Procedure to find the best k:**

  1. Test KMeans with `k` from, say, 2 to 10.
  2. For each k, compute:

     * **Inertia** (sum of squared distances of points to their cluster centroid)
     * **Silhouette score** (how well-separated clusters are, ranges -1 to 1)
  3. **Elbow method:** Look at inertia vs k → find the “elbow point” where adding more clusters **doesn’t reduce inertia much**.
  4. **Check silhouette score:** pick k with higher silhouette (ideally > 0.5).

 So **best k = elbow + high silhouette**.

## ** Agglomerative Clustering**

* **Hyperparameters:**

  * `n_clusters = k`
  * `linkage = ['ward', 'complete', 'average', 'single']`
* **Procedure to find best k:**

  1. Test all combinations of k (2–10) and linkage methods.
  2. For each combination, compute **silhouette score**.
  3. Pick the combination with **highest silhouette score**.

 So **best k = number of clusters with highest silhouette score**, linkage is chosen along with it.

## **DBSCAN**

* **Hyperparameters:**

  * `eps` = maximum distance between points in a cluster
  * `min_samples` = minimum points to form a dense cluster
* **Procedure to find the best parameters:**

  1. Test a **grid of eps and min_samples values**.
  2. For each combination, compute:

     * **Number of clusters** formed
     * **Silhouette score** (computed only on points assigned to clusters, ignore noise `-1`)
     * **Percentage of points labeled as noise** (want it low, ideally < 10%)
  3. **Pick the combination** where:

     * Silhouette score is **high** (good separation)
     * Noise percentage is **low** (most points clustered)
     * Number of clusters is reasonable (optional, if you want similar number to KMeans/AC)

So for DBSCAN, **best eps & min_samples → high silhouette + low noise**.

### **Key difference summary:**

| Method        | Hyperparameter to tune | How to pick best clusters                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| KMeans        | `n_clusters = k`       | Elbow in inertia + high silhouette               |
| Agglomerative | `n_clusters + linkage` | Max silhouette                                   |
| DBSCAN        | `eps, min_samples`     | Max silhouette + low noise + reasonable clusters |
